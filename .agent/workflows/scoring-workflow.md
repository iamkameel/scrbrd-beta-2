In cricket, when a batter is dismissed (out), the **attribution of the wicket** depends on the **mode of dismissal**. The wicket can be credited to the **bowler**, **fielder**, **wicketkeeper**, or simply logged as a **team wicket** in some cases. Let’s break down each scenario:

---

### 🏏 **1. Bowler-Attributed Wickets**

| **Mode of Dismissal**       | **Description**                                                                                      | **Wicket Credited To**               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Bowled**                  | The ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails.                                                    | Bowler                               |
| **Caught**                  | A fielder or wicketkeeper catches the ball on the full after it touches the bat or glove.            | Bowler (catch credited to fielder)   |
| **LBW (Leg Before Wicket)** | The ball strikes the batter’s leg or body (not bat) in line with the stumps and would have hit them. | Bowler                               |
| **Stumped**                 | The wicketkeeper breaks the stumps while the batter is out of the crease after missing the ball.     | Bowler (stumping credited to keeper) |
| **Hit Wicket**              | The batter accidentally dislodges the bails while playing a shot or setting off for a run.           | Bowler                               |

#### 🧠 **Logic Check**:

* Even though the **fielder or keeper takes the catch or stumping**, the dismissal is still attributed to the **bowler**.
* The logic here is that the bowler’s delivery **created the chance** for dismissal.

### 🧤 **2. Fielder-Attributed Wickets**

| **Mode of Dismissal**     | **Description**                                                                       | **Wicket Credited To**                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Run Out**               | A fielder breaks the stumps with the ball while the batter is out of the crease.      | Fielder (throw) or Keeper (direct hit) |
| **Obstructing the Field** | The batter deliberately obstructs a fielder trying to take a catch or make a run out. | No individual credit - Team Wicket     |

#### 🧠 **Logic Check**:

* **Run Outs** can be directly credited to the **fielder who throws** or the **keeper who hits the stumps**.
* **Obstruction** is a rare dismissal that does not credit any player directly.

### 🪓 **3. Keeper-Attributed Wickets**

| **Mode of Dismissal** | **Description**                                                       | **Wicket Credited To**                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Stumped**           | Wicketkeeper breaks the stumps while the batter is out of the crease. | Bowler (but keeper credited for stumping) |
| **Caught Behind**     | Wicketkeeper takes a catch from an edge or glove.                     | Bowler (catch credited to keeper)         |

#### 🧠 **Logic Check**:

* Although the **keeper performs the final action**, the **bowler gets credit** since the delivery induced the error.

### ⏱️ **4. Team-Attributed Wickets**

| **Mode of Dismissal**           | **Description**                                                                                | **Wicket Credited To** |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Timed Out**                   | The incoming batter does not arrive within 3 minutes.                                          | Team Wicket            |
| **Handled the Ball (obsolete)** | Batter touches the ball with a hand not holding the bat (now part of “Obstructing the Field”). | Team Wicket            |
| **Hit Ball Twice**              | The batter intentionally strikes the ball twice (except to protect the wicket).                | Team Wicket            |

#### 🧠 **Logic Check**:

* **No player credit** here since the dismissal occurs due to the batter’s action or inaction.

### ⚖️ **5. Scoring Attribution of Wickets**

| **Type of Out**           | **Bowler Stats** | **Fielder Stats** |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| **Bowled**                | +1 Wicket        | -                 |
| **Caught**                | +1 Wicket        | +1 Catch          |

| **Hit Wicket**            | +1 Wicket        | -                 |
| **Timed Out**             | -                | -                 |

### 🗺️ **Alternative Perspective**

While most of these attributions are standard, some formats or competitions may attribute **“run outs” as team dismissals** rather than to the individual fielder. This is done to maintain uniformity in scoring and simplify statistics.

---

### 🔄 **Assumption to Challenge:**

* **"The player making the final action always gets the wicket credit."**

  * False. The **bowler is credited** even if a fielder completes the catch or stumping.

---

Let’s break down the **run scoring mechanism in cricket** and how runs are attributed to both **batsmen** and **bowlers**, along with the **impact on totals**.

---

## 🏏 **1. Run Scoring: The Basics**

Runs are the fundamental unit of scoring in cricket. They are scored when:

* The batsmen **run between the wickets** after hitting the ball.
* The ball **reaches the boundary** (4 or 6).
* **Extras** are conceded by the fielding team (No Ball, Wide, Bye, Leg Bye).

---

## 🔢 **2. Attribution of Runs: How It Works**

### 📝 **A. Runs Scored Off the Bat**

These are credited directly to the **batsman’s personal score**.

| **Method of Scoring**       | **Description**                                       | **Runs Attributed To**     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Running Between Wickets** | Batsmen run between creases after hitting the ball.   | Batter who hit the ball    |
| **Boundary (4)**            | Ball touches or crosses boundary on the ground.       | Batter who struck the ball |
| **Boundary (6)**            | Ball clears the boundary without touching the ground. | Batter who struck the ball |

### 📌 **Impact on Bowler’s Figures**:

* Runs scored off the bat are **added to the bowler’s tally** if they bowled the delivery.
* Example: If a bowler concedes a boundary, it counts as **4 runs against their bowling figures**.

---

### 🪙 **B. Extras (Non-Batsman Runs)**

Extras are **not credited to the batter** but count towards the **team’s total**.

| **Type of Extra** | **How It Happens**                                      | **Attributed To**               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **No Ball**       | Illegal delivery (overstep, beamer, etc.)               | Bowler (1 extra + runs)         |
| **Wide**          | Ball passes too wide for batter to hit                  | Bowler (1 extra + runs)         |
| **Bye**           | Ball passes without touching bat or batter              | Team (not the bowler)           |
| **Leg Bye**       | Ball hits batter’s body (not bat) and runs are taken    | Team (not the bowler)           |
| **Penalty Runs**  | Awarded for breaches (ball tampering, illegal fielding) | Team (not attributed to bowler) |

#### 📌 **Impact on Bowler’s Figures**:

* **No Balls and Wides** are **charged to the bowler**.
* **Byes and Leg Byes** are **not counted against the bowler**.

---

## 🏏 **3. Impact on Totals:**

### **Team Score Calculation:**

* Sum of **batting runs + extras**.
* Example: If a batsman scores **40 runs** and the team accumulates **10 extras**, the total is **50/2**.

### **Bowler's Economy and Average:**

* Runs scored off the bowler’s deliveries (including **No Balls and Wides**) are added to the **bowler’s tally**.
* **Byes and Leg Byes** do not count as bowler-conceded runs.

## 🔄 **4. Specific Scenarios:**

| **Scenario**                        | **Runs to Batsman** | **Runs to Bowler** | **Runs to Team Total** |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Batsman hits for 4**              | +4                  | +4                 | +4                     |
| **No Ball + hit for 2**             | +2                  | +3 (1 NB + 2 runs) | +3                     |
| **Wide + 3 byes**                   | 0                   | +1 (Wide only)     | +4                     |
| **Leg Bye 2**                       | 0                   | 0                  | +2                     |
| **Batsman hit for 6 on a Free Hit** | +6                  | +7 (1 NB + 6 runs) | +7                     |

## 💡 **Key Principles to Remember:**

1. **Batsman-Centric Runs**:

   * Any runs directly resulting from the batter’s strike (including edges and boundaries) are **credited to the batter**.

2. **Bowler Attribution**:

   * **Runs scored off the bat** on a legal delivery are added to the **bowler’s figures**.
   * **No Balls and Wides** are **also attributed to the bowler**.

3. **Extras and Team Total**:

   * Extras are **not credited to the batter** but **increase the team total**.
   * Bowler is **not penalized for Byes and Leg Byes**.

---

## 🧠 **Assumptions to Challenge:**

1. **“All runs go to the batsman.”**

   * Incorrect. **Extras** do not belong to the batter’s personal tally.

2. **“Bowler is always penalized for runs on his delivery.”**

   * Incorrect. Byes and Leg Byes are **not counted against the bowler**, even if it was their delivery.

3. **“If a ball is a No Ball, any runs scored off it are all extras.”**

   * Incorrect. The **No Ball itself is 1 extra**; any subsequent runs from the bat are **added to the batsman’s score**.

---

## 📝 **Example Scenario:**

1. Bowler delivers a **No Ball** (1 run).
2. Batter hits the No Ball for **4**.
3. Total runs from the delivery: **5 (1 NB + 4 from the bat)**.
4. **Batsman’s Score**: +4
   **Bowler’s Figures**: +5
   **Team Total**: +5
